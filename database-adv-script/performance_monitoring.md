# Report: Continuously Monitoring and Refining Database Performance

## Objective

The goal of this task was to continuously monitor and refine the database performance by analyzing query execution plans using SQL commands like `SHOW PROFILE` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. Based on the analysis, bottlenecks were identified, and improvements were implemented, such as new indexes or schema adjustments, to enhance performance.

## Problem Statement

As databases grow and queries become more complex, query execution times may increase, leading to performance issues. It is important to continuously monitor query performance, identify inefficiencies, and implement changes to ensure optimal database operation. This task focused on identifying performance bottlenecks in frequently used queries and refining the schema to improve overall performance.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Monitoring Query Performance

To identify potential performance issues, we used the following SQL commands to analyze frequently used queries:

1. **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: This command provides detailed information about how a query is executed, including the execution time, number of rows, and the query plan. It was used to analyze queries with potential performance concerns.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE user_id = 1;
   ```

2. **SHOW PROFILE**: This command allows us to view profiling information about query execution, including time spent on different stages of execution.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 1;
   ```

We ran these commands for several frequently used queries, such as:

- Retrieving bookings for a specific user.
- Fetching properties in a specific location.
- Retrieving payments for a given booking.

### Step 2: Analyzing Query Execution Plans

Using the output from `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `SHOW PROFILE`, we analyzed query execution times and identified potential bottlenecks:

- **Inefficient Joins**: Some queries used multiple joins that were not optimized, causing unnecessary overhead.
- **Lack of Indexing**: Queries filtering by specific columns (e.g., `user_id`, `location`) lacked proper indexes, resulting in full table scans.
- **Unoptimized Query Plan**: Some queries were performing inefficient operations due to improper use of indexes or missing indexes.

### Step 3: Identifying Bottlenecks and Suggesting Changes

Based on the analysis, the following bottlenecks were identified:

1. **Slow Joins**: Some queries were joining large tables without indexes on the join columns, causing inefficient scans.
2. **Missing Indexes**: Queries filtering by columns such as `user_id` and `location` did not have indexes, resulting in slow performance for large datasets.
3. **Full Table Scans**: Some queries required scanning the entire table due to lack of proper filtering or indexing.

### Step 4: Implementing Changes

To address these bottlenecks, the following changes were implemented:

1. **Created Indexes on Frequently Used Columns**: Indexes were created on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses, such as `user_id`, `location`, and `booking_id`.

   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON Booking(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_location ON Property(location);
   ```

2. **Optimized Joins**: Some queries were refactored to reduce the number of joins or to join on indexed columns to speed up query execution.

3. **Analyzed and Refactored Queries**: Some queries were rewritten for better performance by using more efficient filtering or grouping techniques.

### Step 5: Performance Testing After Changes

After implementing the changes, the performance of the modified queries was tested using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `SHOW PROFILE`. Here are the results:

1. **Before Changes**: Queries involving `JOIN` operations on large tables were slow due to missing indexes and inefficient joins.
2. **After Changes**: The queries ran faster, as the database could now

use the newly created indexes for faster data retrieval, and the joins were optimized to reduce the execution time.

For example, a query retrieving bookings for a specific user, which previously took several seconds, now runs in less than a second after creating the `user_id` index.

### Step 6: Continuous Monitoring

To ensure the database remains performant, ongoing monitoring using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and other profiling tools is essential. We will continue to assess the performance of queries, especially as data grows, and make adjustments to the schema or indexes as necessary.

## Observed Improvements

- **Faster Query Execution**: The implementation of indexes significantly improved the performance of queries, especially for those filtering by frequently used columns like `user_id` and `location`.
- **Reduced Query Times**: Execution times for queries with multiple joins decreased dramatically after the refactoring and indexing.
- **Optimized Resource Usage**: The database engine was able to utilize indexes efficiently, leading to less CPU and memory usage for query execution.

## Conclusion

The next steps will involve setting up automated performance monitoring and refining the database schema periodically to address any future performance issues.
